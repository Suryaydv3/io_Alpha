Introduction
This project focuses on creating a Digital Twin for a water distribution network aimed at efficient water management. By simulating and monitoring the water network, it helps reduce water waste and improve resource access. The system includes an IoT device simulation, integration with Arduino, and a Machine Learning model for predictive analysis.
Problem Statement
"Digital Twin for Water Management: Develop a digital twin of a water distribution network that helps manage water resources efficiently, reducing waste and improving access."

Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
•	Git
•	Arduino IDE
•	Proteus (for circuit simulation)
Cloning the Repository
To begin, clone the repository containing the project:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/alpha-team/water-management-digital-twin.git
cd water-management-digital-twin
________________________________________
Step 1: Export Compiled Binary
1.	Navigate to the water_sensor_simulation.ino file in the Arduino IDE.
2.	In the Sketch menu, click on Export Compiled Binary to generate a .hex file of the Arduino sketch.
3.	Locate the exported binary file in the sketch_sep28a/build/arduino.avr.uno/ directory. The file should be named sketch_sep28a.ino.hex.
________________________________________
Step 2: Setting Up Arduino Project in Proteus
1.	Unzip the Final design.zip file you downloaded.
2.	Open the arduino.pdsprj file inside the Final design directory using Proteus.
3.	Select the Arduino board in the design.
4.	Double-click on the board and navigate to the Program File field.
5.	Browse and select the exported compiled binary (.hex file) from the Arduino sketch created in Step 1.
________________________________________
Development
The core of the development process revolves around simulating the water distribution network using IoT sensors and Arduino. The Machine Learning model for predictive maintenance is located in the dital_twin.zip file.
________________________________________
Usage
1.	Once the setup is complete, simulate the water distribution network using Proteus and Arduino.
2.	Use the Machine Learning model from dital_twin.zip for real-time prediction and analysis of water management, helping reduce waste and optimize resource allocation.
